# VoyageNav-Intelligent-Route-Optimization

This project helps travelers plan **optimal travel routes** between multiple locations using **graph data structures**. It simulates locations as nodes and routes (roads, trains, flights) as edges with weighted costs (e.g., distance, time, or expense). The application calculates the **shortest or most efficient path** between two or more locations according to user-defined criteria.

![Route Planner Demo]()

Here path represented with blue colour shows a route from India to Russia whereas red colour shows the shortest route from India to Russia, which we are  optimizing with the graph algos.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Learn how to implement and visualize **graph-based data structures**.
- Understand **directed**, **undirected**, and **weighted graphs**.
- Practice implementing **adjacency list** or **adjacency matrix** representations.
- Apply **shortest-path algorithms** like **Dijkstra’s**, **DFS**, and **BFS**.
- Build logic for **efficient pathfinding** and constraint-based routing.
- Explore **API integration** for dynamic, real-world data.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🗺️ Interactive route calculation
- ⏱️ Travel time, distance, and cost-based optimization
- 🚦 Constraint handling (budget, mode of travel, stopovers)
- ⚡ Efficient algorithmic backend using **Dijkstra’s**, **BFS**, and **DFS**
- 🌐 Optional integration with real-world APIs (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or Travel APIs)

---

## 🚧 Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of **Python**, **JavaScript**, or any other language of your choice
- Understanding of **graphs** and **pathfinding algorithms**
- Tools/libraries like:
  - For Python: `networkx`, `matplotlib`
  - For Web: `Leaflet.js`, `D3.js`, `Node.js` (if needed)
- Here I have used `HTML`, `Javascript` and `C++` for graph algos.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. **Graph Representation**
- Nodes = Locations (Cities, Places)
- Edges = Routes (Flights, Trains, Roads)
- Weights = Cost, Distance, or Time

### 2. **Graph Traversal**
- Use **DFS** or **BFS** to explore all possible paths

### 3. **Shortest Path Algorithm**
- Use **Dijkstra’s algorithm** to compute the most efficient route based on your chosen weight type (time/cost/distance)

### 4. **Constraints Handling**
- Users can specify:
  - Preferred travel modes (flight, road, rail)
  - Max budget
  - Intermediate stopovers or avoidance zones

### 5. **Real-Time Updates**
- (Optional) Use APIs to fetch live travel data, delays, or pricing info

## 🧪 How to Use

1. 🔍 Input your **source** and **destination**
2. 💼 Set your **travel preferences**:
   - Mode of transport
   - Maximum budget
   - Desired stopovers or cities to avoid
3. 🚀 Run the system to generate:
   - 📍 Optimal route
   - 💰 Estimated cost
   - ⏳ Estimated travel time
